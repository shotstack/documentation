# Host your Own Assets

If you have your own hosting provider or your application does not require any kind of public hosting you can opt-out
from having your videos automatically hosted. You can still use the Editing API to edit videos and images, download
the created asset but instruct Shotstack to not move your assets to hosting.

### Opt out from hosting

To opt out from hosting you need to add the following JSON to the output section of your render requests:

```json
"destinations": [{
    "provider": "shotstack",
    "exclude": true
}]
```

Your final output JSON will look something like:

```json
"output": {
    "format": "mp4",
    "resolution": "sd",
    "destinations": [{
        "provider": "shotstack",
        "exclude": true
    }]
}
```

:::info Tip

You can set `exclude` to `false` to opt-in or omit the destinations section entirely.

### Retrieve the asset directly from the Editing API

If you are not using Shotstack's built in hosting then you will still need to retrieve the asset generated by the 
editing API. The URL of the final asset is returned in the response of the status request or 
[webhooks](/architecting-an-application/webhooks.md). You will need to 
[download the asset](/architecting-an-application/guidelines.md#download-video-when-rendered) and move it to your own 
storage location within 24 hours.
